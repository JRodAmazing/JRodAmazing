👋 Hi, I’m Justin “J.Rod” Roden
AI Solutions Engineer | Rocket Engine Test Engineer | Industrial Builder | Consultant

I’m a hands-on builder who crossed industries the hard way:
from oilfield + heavy equipment → construction executive → aerospace rocket test engineering → industrial consultant → AI software engineer.

My background sits at the intersection of mechanical grit, aerospace precision, construction operations, and AI systems engineering.

I solve complex, real-world problems using logic, code, and creativity — the same way I solved problems turning wrenches, running field ops, or making rocket engines safe to fire.

🚀 Who I Am

I started in the oil & heavy-mechanics world — long days, problem-solving under pressure, hydraulics, electrical systems, and equipment diagnostics. That environment built my foundation: precision, toughness, and results-first thinking.

From there, I stepped into construction operations and executive leadership, managing multi-million-dollar workflows, fleets, estimating, and operational strategy.

But my career took a major leap when I transitioned into aerospace.

🧑‍🚀 Aerospace Engineering Background

Before diving into software and AI, I went to work in one of the hardest environments on the planet:

🚀 Rocket Engine Test Engineer — SpaceX & Blue Origin

I worked hands-on with engine test systems, launch operations, and flight readiness across multiple rocket programs.
My work directly supported R&D, engine validation, pre-flight operations, and mission-critical system checks.

Highlights

12+ successful mission patches from SpaceX

Worked with engine development teams to ensure engines met launch requirements

Performed operational checks, troubleshooting, data validation, and engine readiness procedures

Supported payload integration workflows across multiple launch cycles

Participated in Blue Origin’s early startup flight operations, setting up test infrastructure and readiness pipelines

Worked alongside world-class aerospace engineers in high-stakes environments where failure was not an option

This chapter of my career gave me aerospace discipline:
precision, speed, system thinking, risk analysis, and operational excellence.

That mindset is now baked into every system and AI model I design.

🤖 AI Solutions Engineering

After aerospace and construction, I realized the biggest inefficiencies in industrial and technical environments could be eliminated with AI, automation, and intelligent software.

Today I build:

AI-driven operational workflows

Intelligent automation layers

Full-stack applications

LLM-powered tools for construction, equipment fleets, aerospace workflows, and industrial operations

I combine hands-on field experience, executive logic, and deep systems engineering to build technology that actually works in real-world environments.

🔥 What I Bring

Blue-collar grit

Aerospace discipline

Construction executive strategy

High-level engineering + AI systems thinking

Ability to take chaos → structure

Ability to take ideas → architecture → code → delivered solution

A builder’s mindset: fast, iterative, and precise

This repo will include demo videos, live builds, frameworks, AI systems, and the personal tools I’m developing as I level up my engineering stack.

📬 Let’s Connect

If you’re building something big — in AI, aerospace, construction tech, robotics, or industrial automation — I’m always open to collaborate.
