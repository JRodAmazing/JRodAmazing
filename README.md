👋 Hi, I’m Justin “J.Rod” Roden
AI Specialist | Rocket Engine Test Engineer | Industrial Builder | Consultant
🧑‍🚀 Aerospace Background — Rocket Engine Test Engineer

Before transitioning fully into AI and software, I spent years working in rocket propulsion test operations — supporting engine development, troubleshooting test systems, and flight-readiness checks. As well as in the trenches with dozers ripping up metric tons of earth on criticle job sites, and preventing expensive downtime at peak moments. 

Highlights

🚀 12+ successful SpaceX mission patches

🛠 Hands-on work with engine test stands, cryogenic systems, high-pressure fluids, telemetry, ignition systems, micro electrical systems, heavy iron force, prevenative main. re-design.

🔍 Supported engine development teams in pre-flight verification and troubleshooting as well as helping engineering design proper equipment upgrades.

🟦 Helped prepare rockets and payload systems for launch, and helped deliver DTC coding within CPU systems. 

🟨 Played a role in Blue Origin’s early startup test operations, assisting with engine readiness and test stand setup as well as new equipment releasing to public with integrated systems for excavation companies.

🛰 High-stakes troubleshooting where precision = mission success

Aerospace gave me a mindset built on:
precision, calm under pressure, systems thinking, and zero-failure tolerance.

🤖 AI Solutions Engineer — What I Do Today

I take everything from mechanics → construction → aerospace → enterprise operations and layer it with modern engineering and AI.

I build intelligent solutions such as:

🧬 AI-driven operational workflows

🔄 Automation layers for high-friction workflows

🧱 Intelligent agents for construction, aerospace, logistics & industrial ops

🖥️ Full-stack applications

🚦 Predictive logic, system orchestration & real-time analysis

🛠 Tools operators, PMs, execs, and field techs actually use

I’m not building AI hype.
I’m building AI that gets work done.
