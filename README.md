Justin “J.Rod” Roden

AI Engineer | Former Rocket Test Engineer | Industrial Systems Builder

I came up through field work, flight-critical engineering, and high-pressure operations before moving fully into software and AI.

Before AI, I worked in rocket engine test operations, supporting development programs, test stands, and flight readiness. I’ve also spent years in heavy equipment, construction, and industrial operations fixing machines, keeping jobs moving, and solving problems when downtime was not an option.

I’ve worked in environments where precision matters, mistakes are expensive, and systems have to work the first time.

That mindset comes with me into software.

Background

I supported engine testing, diagnostics, and launch preparation for major aerospace programs. I worked with cryogenic systems, high-pressure fluid systems, instrumentation, control systems, and telemetry. I was also involved in early operations and test support during the startup phase of a major commercial space company.

On the ground side, I’ve worked deep in construction, civil, and heavy equipment operations including mechanical diagnostics, hydraulic systems, diesel troubleshooting, and field leadership. I understand how crews work, how sites move, and what breaks down in high-pressure operations.

As a consultant and technical leader, I’ve handled operations oversight, cost control, estimating, vendor relationships, and system design across multiple industries.

What I Do Now

Today, I build production AI systems.

I design and deploy intelligence that supports real operations. Workflows that remove friction instead of adding it. Automation that respects reality. Software that people actually use.

I build:
AI driven operational systems
Automation for high friction workflows
Agent based systems for industrial environments
Full stack applications
Predictive logic and real time analytics

I am not here for AI hype.

I build AI that gets work done.

What Sets Me Apart

I combine field experience, aerospace discipline, enterprise thinking, and engineering execution. I understand operations, people, systems, and risk. I build tools that fit the world instead of forcing the world to fit the tool.

Let’s Connect

If you are working in AI, aerospace, construction tech, robotics, or industrial systems, I’m open to connect and collaborate.
